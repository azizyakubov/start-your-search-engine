# Students, Start your (search) Engines!

SPA built with react to allow for filtering through a list of students as part of a coding project for StartEngine

The list must be searchable by the first name given a text input. Allow users to type in the text field to filter the list of the given students. The endpoint does not provide you with queries so you must find a way to search using any javascript library you wish to use.

Also, each student will have a list of classes theyâ€™re enrolled in. Using the list of students you get, dynamically create a dropdown that will allow users to find the students enrolled in a class. For example, if student A is enrolled in math and art and student B is enrolled in Math and history, the dropdown must include all the non-repeating options (math, art, and history in this case). If math is chosen, you must show A and B. If history is chosen, you must only show student B. So on and so forth. You must also include a neutral option in the dropdown that would list all students to go back to the main list.

This project must include the following methods and concepts:

1. Hooks

2. Redux thunk

3. CSS, or SCSS, or any javascript library that is used for styling
